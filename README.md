# AppSource
OpenSource AppStore for Developers to share iOS Applications

All applications are stored direclty on GitHub at the developers original repository, AppSource indexes public repositories to allow users to search for the apps they want download them and install to their local iOS device without the need of AppStore or other adhoc software distribution methods.

The original developer of the app does not require to have a full Apple Developer account as the application is downloaded and signed by the user. This makes AppSource ideal for sharing iOS apps for purposes of evaluation by other developers. Currently AppSource requires the end user to have full Apple Developer subscription, however work is under way to reduce that requirement to just having a free Apple Developer account.


# Installation
git clone
pip install .

# Upgrading
You may upgrade AppSource via built in "upgrade" ("apps upgrade") command, if that fails please reinstall it.

# Usage
You will need to "update" the index before you search for or install any modules, you can do so via:
"apps update"
You can then "search" and "install" apps as you see fit. Please note that software is currently under heavy development so a lot of things will not go smoothly...
